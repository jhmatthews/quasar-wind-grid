The grids of output files can be downloaded by clicking the zip or tar.gz buttons to the left.\r\n\r\nfilenames are as follows (this is the fiducial model):\r\nrun42_thmin70_rmin50_a0p5_rv1e19_f0p01.spec\r\n\r\nwhere the variables are as defined in the paper, i.e.\r\n\r\n* f- volume filling factor, 0.1 (0p1) or 0.01 (0p01)\r\n* thmin - minimum wind angle, 70 or 55.\r\n* rmin - minimum launch radius, 10,30,or 50\r\n* a - alpha, acceleration exponent, 0.5,0.6, or 1\r\n* rv - acceleration length, 1e18 or 1e19\r\n\r\n### Directory Structure\r\n\r\nSpectra are split into two grids, depending on clumping factor, and in folders\r\n* synthetic_spectra_f0p1/\r\n* synthetic_spectra_f0p01/\r\n\r\n### Processing Output Files\r\n\r\nThe output spectrum files follow the astropy conventions with the format\r\n\r\nFreq.        Lambda  Created  Emitted   CenSrc  Disk     Wind     HitSurf Scattered A20 \r\n4.002830e+14 7489.514     0.177    0.149   0.0217    0.127  0.00031    0.029        0    0.307   \r\n\r\nAnd thus can be read into a table with the commands\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nfrom astropy.io import ascii\r\ndata = ascii.read(filename)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could then make an Flambda flux density plot with wavelength at 20 degrees by doing\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport pylab as plt\r\nplt.plot(data[\"Lambda\"], data[\"A20\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny questions or comments, email me at jm8g08 [at] soton.ac.uk.
