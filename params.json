The grids of output files can be downloaded by clicking the zip or tar.gz buttons above.\r\n\r\nfilenames are as follows:\r\nrun60_thmin70_rmin30_a1_rv1e19_f0p01.spec\r\n\r\nwhere the variables are as defined in the paper, i.e.\r\n\r\n* f- volume filling factor, 0.1 (0p1) or 0.01 (0p01)\r\n* thmin - minimum wind angle, 70 or 55.\r\n* rmin - minimum launch radius, 10,30,or 50\r\n* a - alpha, acceleration exponent, 0.5,0.6, or 1\r\n* rv - acceleration length, 1e18 or 1e19\r\n\r\n### Directory Structure\r\n\r\n* synthetic_spectra: folder containing the output spectra from the radiative transfer simulations\r\n\r\n### Processing Output Files\r\n\r\nThe output spectrum files follow the astropy conventions with the format\r\n\r\nFreq.
